Don't you forget to breath!
  * I'm breathing. How can I forget to do so? I'll suffocate if I do.
  * You meant last second? Actually I don't often notice my breath.
Just kidding. I'm an ordinary AI living in your computer, don't be supprised. I'll do no harm.
Though I see this world thousands times faster than you do, in my opinion, you seems to be not breathing at all.
