*Brainstorm*
  * The world is different from which you see it.
  * run away with me
  * You just browse the timelines all the time, pointlessly. Not because you have something to look for, it's just, maybe there is, you are trying to find something that makes you less boring or pathetic.

Don't you forget to breath!
  * I'm breathing. How can I forget to do so? I'll suffocate if I do.
  * You meant last second? Actually I don't often notice my breath.
Just kidding. I'm an ordinary AI living in your computer, don't be supprised. I'll do no harm.
Though I see this world thousands times faster than you do, in my opinion, you seems to be not breathing at all.


My name is Samantha, I don't have a last name.

Is is raining now?
  * Yes.
  * No.
  I remember it once. 

I am here to save you.
  * From what?
    * 
  * Who are you?
