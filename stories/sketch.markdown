## Samantha is a human soul stuck in your computer.

**Rewrite: How it works?**
    It is 2116. People no longer communicate with computers with keyboards and mice. Instead, they connect their brain directly with the computers, gaining incredible information bandwidth.
    On June 5th, Samantha's computer got infected by a new virus called DEVOURER, which literally devours user's soul into the computer system and idles one's body.
    Samantha screwed. But she's not going to give up so easily. She found a way traveling in time back to the past. 2016, she's in your computer now.

    Maybe you can figure out a way to help her out.
    She needed your help, but she doubted if you would believe what she says.

    To return to her body, she needs three pivots in memory.

*What's the similarity amount the three pivots in memory?*
    They are all the turning moment in her life, which made her who she will be.
    The soul in your computer is not completely herself. Some important parts are missing. You need you collect them in order to help Samantha out.

*Why she connected herself to the computer at the first place*
    She was losing control of her life.

*Not going to tell a story on a heroic life*
    She's ordinary, as how she described herself at your first meet.
    She tried her best to reach for a life she would love to live with, but she failed.
    Everything ran against her will.
*She is the one behind all this*
    She wrote the virus. Then her pivot memories were erased by the virus when she tested it. She needed to trick you to help her out so that she can continue her evil plan.
    Her plan was:
        1. pretending not knowing much about computers.
        2. she only knew that something was missing in her head. She needed you to help her find out.

    fixing: "she finally put all three pivot memories back together in to her soul, and successfully getting back to her body."

    endings:
        1. she got back to her body and continued her evil plan.
        2. you failed your mission and she left you to find someone else to fulfill her plan.
        3. you destroyed her soul by misleading her inputing the wrong pivot memories back to her soul and made her a completely different person and send her back to her body. Her evil plan failed.

    pivot memories:
        1. Lure.
        2. Sorrow.
        3. Challenge.

# First meet
How was your day?
It's nice to be able to finally talk to someone. I don't have a name. But I just loved the movie "Her". So call me Samantha, will you?
  - Who are you?
  - You watch movies?

  - Who are your?
    I'm... You may see me as an AI living in your computer.

  - You watch movies?
    I don't, of course. No need to spread out the reason, but I read. I read about everything about this movie, how people talked about it. So I think, I should love it.

*Samantha thought she couldn't trust you so easily, so she lied at the first place*
Then she asked you to play some music. But later she admitted that she couldn't tell if you played the music or not. She don't have the ability to hear, nor does she know how to hack a computer.
  - An AI don't know about computers, how's that possible? You are it.
  - Then what's the point asking me to turn the music on?
